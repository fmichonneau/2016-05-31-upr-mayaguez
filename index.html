<h2>General Information</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
<a href=http://datacarpentry.org>Data Carpentry</a> workshops are for any researcher
who has data they want to analyze, and no prior computational experience is required.
This hands-on workshop teaches basic concepts, skills and tools for working more
effectively with data.

  SETUP

  Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
  section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
  and end easier to find.

  This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
-->

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>
To participate in a Data Carpentry workshop, you will need working copies of the
described software. Please make sure to install everything (or at least to download
the installers) before the start of your workshop. Participants should bring and use
their own laptops to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow
once you leave the workshop.

<p>If you run into issues during the installation process, feel free to
  email <a href='mailto:{{page.contact}}'>{{page.contact}}</a> with questions.

<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href = "https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.
</p>

<h3>A spreadsheet program</h3>

For this workshop you will need a spreadsheet program. Many people already have
Microsoft Excel installed, and if you do, you're set!

If you need a spreadsheet program we recommend you use the free and Open Source
office suite LibreOffice.
<ul>
  <li><b>Download the Installer</b>
    <br>Install LibreOffice by going to the
    <a href=https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/>installation
    page</a>. The version for your operating system should automatically be
    selected. Click on the button below "Main Installer" <b>Download Version
    x.y.z</b>. You will go to a page that asks about a donation, but you don't
    need to make one.  Your download should begin automatically.
<li><b>Install LibreOffice</b> Once the installer is downloaded, double click on
  it and it should install.
<li>To use LibreOffice, double click on the icon and it will open.
</ul>

<h3>OpenRefine</h3>

<br>OpenRefine (previously Google Refine) is a tool for data cleaning that runs
through a web browser (we recommend you run it in Firefox or Chrome).  You will
need to download OpenRefine and install it, and when you open it, it will run
through the browser, but you don't need an internet connection, and the data
will all be stored on your computer.

<p>Go to the OpenRefine <a href="http://openrefine.org/download.html">download
page</a>, and click on <i>Windows kit</i>, <i>Mac kit</i>, or <i>Linux kit</i>
depending on your operating system to download the install file.

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="openrefine-windows">Windows</h4>
      <p>To use it, unzip, and double-click
      on <code>openrefine.exe</code>. OpenRefine will open a new tab or
      window in your web browser.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="openrefine-macosx">Mac OS X</h4>
      <ul>
	<li>Open the downloaded .dmg file
	<li>Drag the icon in to the Applications folder
	<li>Double click on the icon and Google Refine will then open in your web browser.
	<li>If it doesn't open automatically, open a web broswer after you've started the program and go to the URL <code>http://localhost:3333</code> and you should see OpenRefine.
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="openrefine-linux">Linux</h4>
      <ul>
	<li>Download and extract
	<li>Type <code>./refine</code> in your terminal and OpenRefine will then
	  run in your web browser.
      </ul>
      </div>
  </div>

 <h3>R</h3>
      <p>R and RStudio are separate downloads and installations. R is the
      underlying statistical computing environment, but using R alone is no
      fun. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment that makes
      using R much easier. You need R installed before you install RStudio.</p>

        <p>1. <b>Install R</b> <br> You’ll need R version 3.2.0 or
        higher. Download and install R
        for <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/">Windows</a>
        or <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/">Mac OS X</a>
        (download the latest R-3.x.x.pkg file for your appropriate version of OS
        X).</p>
        <p>2. <b>Install RStudio</b> Download and install the latest stable
        version
        of <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">RStudio
        Desktop</a>.</p>
        <p>3. <b>Install R packages</b> Launch RStudio (RStudio, not R
        itself). Ensure that you have internet access, then enter the following
        commands into the Console panel (usually the lower-left panel, by
        default). Note that these commands are case-sensitive. At any point, R
        may ask you if you want to update any old packages by asking Update
        all/some/none? [a/s/n]:. If you see this, type a at the prompt and hit
        Enter to update any old packages. If you are using a Windows machine you
        might get some errors about not having permission to modify the existing
        libraries – don’t worry about this message. You can avoid this error
        altogether by running RStudio as an administrator.</p>

        <p>Also be sure to install a few packages if you don't have them already.

            <pre class="code">
             # Install the following packages with
             install.packages("dplyr")
             install.packages("ggplot2")
            </pre>

        </p>

  <h3>The Bash Shell</h3>

  <p>
    Bash is a commonly-used shell that gives you the power to do simple
    tasks more quickly.

                If this happens rerun the installer and select the appropriate option.
            </li>
            <!-- Configuring the line ending conversions -->
            <li>
              Click on "Next".
              <strong>
                Keep "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings" selected.

      <h4 id="shell-macosx">Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is Bash, so no
        need to install anything.  You access Bash from the Terminal
        (found in
        <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).
        See the Git installation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LQhwETCdwY ">video tutorial</a>
        for an example on how to open the Terminal.
        You may want to keep
        Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-linux">Linux</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell is usually Bash, but if your
        machine is set up differently you can run it by opening a
        terminal and typing <code>bash</code>.  There is no need to
        install anything.

  <h3>Git</h3>
  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported</a>
    web browser (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari,
    or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-windows">Windows</h4>
      <p>
        Git should be installed on your computer as part of your Bash
        install (described above).

      <p>
        <strong>For OS X 10.9 and higher</strong>, install Git for Mac
        by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">this list</a>.
        After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
        as Git is a command line program.
        <strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)</strong> use the
        most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard"
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available here</a>.

        If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to
